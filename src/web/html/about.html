                    Hello and welcome !<br>
                    <br> Everything began with a project in class where we had to create a little game. We had letters and with them we had to find the longest word. After that's just the craziness of three classmates and some ideas. First we coded a
                    version playable in the terminal with 2 players on the same computer. <br>The next step was to create an LAN version, still in the terminal using sockets. It worked if everyone was on the same network and had the game files.<br>And
                    here we are now, with a version that runs on a single server and allows people to connect and play in their web browser from all around the world. That's what we have today and we are very proud of that. <br>
                    <br> We hope you enjoy this game !
