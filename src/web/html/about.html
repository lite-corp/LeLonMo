                Hello and welcome !<br>
                <br>
                Everything began with a project in class where we had to create a little game. We had letters and with those letters we had to find the longest word.
                After that’s just the craziness of three classmates and some ideas. First we created the terminal version with 2 players on the same computer.
                Next step was to create an online version in the terminal, if everyone was on the same network and had the game file then we could play with several players.
                The goal of this project was an html version with account. That's we have here today and we are very proud of that. <br>
                <br>
                We hope you enjoy this game !
